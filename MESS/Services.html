    <h1>Services we provide </h1>
    <p><h3> One of the main concerns of our parents when they drop us to collage is, what will my child eat? Will he get to eat something nutritional, or will he go to bed empty stomach!
        Ever since internet has been a part of our life it has made it easier. We get to know everything in just a few seconds. With the help of internet, we can gain the wisdom of whole universe. Our project is a food website which provides information about a mess where we can go to eat or order food. 
        So, you might have multiple questions about it like what makes our website different from other food apps like Zomato and Swiggy.  
        Food apps like swiggy, Zomato will provide us the variety in restaurants. Most students don't eat every day from restaurants. Which isn't even healthy to eat everyday So most of the students join a mess . So, we are making things easier for them by adding all the good mess around the area in our website. 
        Why not google it or just dial?
        If you google it or just dial it then you will get the names of different mess but most of them are irrelevant to cater our needs. But, surprisingly we do have a fair share of small scale mess  with awesome taste and at very reasonable price still either  many of them canâ€™t be found on google or are not close enough from our collage so that we can just finish our lunch and come back in just 45 min of a lunch break. 
        
        Consuming nutritional food is very important. If not consumed in right amount it affects our both mental and physical wellbeing. We have considered even the smallest detail while working on this website so that we can provide the best possible service to our website users.</h3>
