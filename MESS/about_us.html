        <h2>One of the main concerns of our parents when they drop us to collage is, what will my child eat? Will he get to eat something nutritional, or will he go to bed empty stomach!
Ever since internet has been a part of our life it has made it easier. We get to know everything in just a few seconds. Our project is a food website which provides information about a mess where we can go to eat or order food. </h2>
